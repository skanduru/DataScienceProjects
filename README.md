# Summarization of some of the Data Science projects in this provided repository completed as part of MIT (OCW) course

## Case Study: PCA and t-SNE for Education and Air Pollution Analysis:

<B>Objective:</B> Reduce the number of features in education and air pollution datasets using PCA and t-SNE.
Education dataset: Analyze information about educational institutes in the USA and visualize it in reduced dimensions.
Air pollution dataset: Analyze relationships between pollutants and meteorological factors using PCA.
## Amazon Product Recommendation System:

<B>Objective:</B> Build a recommendation system based on user ratings in the Amazon product reviews dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis and filter the dataset based on certain assumptions.
Implement rank-based, user-user similarity, item-item similarity, and matrix factorization recommendation systems.
Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning and compare their performance metrics.
## CNN: Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition

<B>Objective:</B> Use CNNs to recognize digits in the SVHN dataset (street-level photos).
Prepare the dataset and build two CNN models with different architectures.
Train and evaluate the models, analyze training and validation accuracies.
Make predictions on the test data, evaluate results using classification report and confusion matrix.
## Bitcoin Prediction

<B>Objective:</B> Build time series models to predict the monthly average closing price of Bitcoin.
Preprocess the dataset, check stationarity, and transform the series to make it stationary.
Build AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models, determine lag values using ACF and PACF plots.
Evaluate models using RMSE and AIC, select ARMA model for predictions.
Forecast future closing prices and evaluate model performance using RMSE.
These summaries provide an overview of the objectives, datasets, techniques, and results for each project
